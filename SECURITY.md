# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep the "YouTube Comment Deleter" script safe.

## Supported Versions

This project is a simple browser console script. Security updates, if necessary, are applied only to the **latest version** available in the `main` branch of this repository. Older versions or specific commits are not actively supported with security patches.

| Version             | Supported          |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest (`main` branch) | :white_check_mark: |
| < Latest            | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability within the script itself, please report it responsibly.

**How to Report:**

* **Preferred Method: Private Reporting:** Please use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature. You can usually find this under the "Security" tab of the repository, then click "Report a vulnerability". This ensures your finding is disclosed privately and allows time for review and potential fixes before public disclosure.
* **Alternative Method (Public Discussion):** If the issue is not sensitive or you cannot use private reporting, you may open a regular [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/moktetip/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/issues) in this repository. Please **do not** include sensitive details (like exploit steps for a critical issue) in public issues.

*(Remember to replace `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` in the Issues link above with your actual repository name, e.g., `youtube-comment-deleter-console`)*

**What to Include:**

Please include the following details in your report:

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if applicable).
* Any potential impact you've identified.
* Mention the version/commit hash if it's relevant (though reports against the latest `main` branch are preferred).

**Our Process:**

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge receipt of private vulnerability reports within **7 business days**.
2.  **Review:** We will review the report to determine if it's a valid vulnerability within the scope of this project. (Note: The script breaking due to changes on Google's website is *not* considered a security vulnerability, but rather a maintenance issue).
3.  **Updates:** You can expect periodic updates on the status of a reported vulnerability via the private reporting channel or the GitHub issue.
4.  **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix for the latest version of the script on a best-effort basis.
5.  **Disclosure:** For accepted vulnerabilities, we may publish a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/moktetip/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/security/advisories) to inform users, potentially coordinating disclosure with you.

We appreciate your effort in responsibly disclosing any security concerns.
